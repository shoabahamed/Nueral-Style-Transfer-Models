# NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER MODELS
This repository contains implementations of various neural style transfer models.
These models allow the transformation of content images to match the artistic style of another image.
The notebooks provided are ready to run on Kaggle with minimal setup.

# Available Models
1. [Artistic Neural Style Transfer](): Implementation of [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)
2. [FastStyleNeuralStyleTransfer](): Implementation of []

# Requirements
To run the notebooks you need:
1. You will need a Kaggle account to access and execute the notebooks.
2. Kaggle gpu
